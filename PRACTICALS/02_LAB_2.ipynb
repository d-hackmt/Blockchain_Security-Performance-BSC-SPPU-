        "One-Way Function: Hashing is a one-way function, meaning that once data is hashed, you cannot reverse the process to get the original data back. This is by design.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fixed-Length Output: A hash function takes an input (which could be of any length) and converts it into a fixed-length string. For example, the SHA-256 function always produces a 256-bit (64-character) output, regardless of the size of the input. This means that even if two different inputs have the same hash length, you cannot tell anything about the input from the hash itself.\n",

        "No Reversible Process: Unlike encryption, which has a method to decrypt the data and get the original information back, hashing does not have a decryption method. Once you generate a hash, the original data is lost, and itâ€™s impossible to recover it.\n",

        "* Dictionary Attacks: Trying words from a list of common words (like from a dictionary) to see if any hash matches.\n",
